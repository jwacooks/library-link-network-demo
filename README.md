# library-link-network-demo
Boston University Libraries began working with Zepheira and other library partners in 2015 to publish bibliographic data using the Bibframe schema (in addition to other linked data schemas) to web sites that can be indexed by standard Internet search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc. The files in this repository are files that are associated with processing and enhancing the bibliographic record and making them discoverable on the web.

The process described and the code provided are admittedly BU-centric, but they are shared here with the hope that they might be helpful to those interested in similar projects. BU Libraries use Ex Libris Alma and Primo as the resource management and discovery systems. In addition, the Libraries maintain a Dspace repository called OpenBU (http://open.bu.edu). The process described here was developed in the context of those systems.

On a regular basis (currently monthly), BU Libraries upload a full set of the bibliographic records maintained in Alma and Dspace.
